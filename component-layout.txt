App
  GameBoard (board, numMines) [board]
    Cell (isMine, setBoard) [isRevealed]
  
Need function to determine where mines go on the board
  - useEffect at the beginning of the game?

Should board exist on App or GameBoard?
How to know when game ends?

TODO:
- Restart button
- Different colors for different numbers
- Reveal all mines when you lose
- Don't allow numbered cells to be flagged
