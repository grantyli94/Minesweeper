App
  GameBoard (board, numMines) [board]
    Cell (isMine, setBoard) [isRevealed]

Should board exist on App or GameBoard?
How to know when game ends?

TODO:
- Add instructions
- Add footer (github/linkedin)
- Make generateBoard/generateMines a useEffect + loading state
- Add color styling for adjacent mines 4+
